 * the way we call g_spawn is still not optimal
   we need to tell it to ignore stdout and stderr when they are not
   provided, for instance

 * implement a way of only allowing the initial client to get info
   currently, any process which is able to obtain auth for the spawn
   action can control any of the running processes; we need to sharpen
   this edge
